HTML5 does not actually have 30 unique `<div>` tags, as the `<div>` is a single, generic container tag used for grouping and styling purposes. However, HTML5 introduced several **semantic elements** that often replace the need for multiple `<div>` elements, providing more meaningful structure to a webpage.

Here’s a list of 30 HTML5 semantic elements and other common elements that are often used in place of multiple `<div>` elements:

1. **`<div>`**: A generic container for grouping content.
2. **`<header>`**: Defines introductory content or a group of navigational links.
3. **`<footer>`**: Specifies footer content, like copyright or contact information.
4. **`<nav>`**: Represents a section of navigation links.
5. **`<article>`**: Represents a self-contained composition in a document.
6. **`<section>`**: Defines a section in a document, used for thematic grouping.
7. **`<aside>`**: Contains content tangentially related to the main content.
8. **`<main>`**: Represents the main content of a document.
9. **`<figure>`**: Used for images, diagrams, or code examples with a caption.
10. **`<figcaption>`**: Provides a caption for a `<figure>` element.
11. **`<hgroup>`**: Groups a set of `<h1>–<h6>` elements to define a multi-level heading.
12. **`<details>`**: Used to create a disclosure widget that users can open and close.
13. **`<summary>`**: Provides a summary or caption for a `<details>` element.
14. **`<dialog>`**: Represents a dialog box or other interactive component.
15. **`<mark>`**: Represents text that should be highlighted.
16. **`<time>`**: Defines a date or time, potentially with machine-readable formatting.
17. **`<output>`**: Represents the result of a calculation or user action.
18. **`<progress>`**: Displays the progress of a task.
19. **`<meter>`**: Represents a scalar measurement within a known range, like a gauge.
20. **`<address>`**: Contains contact information for its nearest article or body.
21. **`<template>`**: Holds client-side content that won’t be rendered until used.
22. **`<blockquote>`**: Indicates a section quoted from another source.
23. **`<pre>`**: Displays preformatted text, maintaining whitespace and line breaks.
24. **`<code>`**: Represents a fragment of computer code.
25. **`<kbd>`**: Indicates input from a keyboard.
26. **`<samp>`**: Used to represent sample output from a computer program.
27. **`<dfn>`**: Marks the defining instance of a term.
28. **`<abbr>`**: Represents an abbreviation or acronym.
29. **`<cite>`**: Cites a reference to a creative work.
30. **`<small>`**: Renders text in a smaller font size, often used for disclaimers or legal text.

Each of these elements can replace a `<div>` when the content it holds fits the semantic meaning of the element. Using these semantic elements improves the accessibility and SEO of your webpage.
