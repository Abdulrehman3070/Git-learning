HTML5 does not actually have 30 unique `<div>` tags, as the `<div>` is a single, generic container tag used for grouping and styling purposes. However, HTML5 introduced several **semantic elements** that often replace the need for multiple `<div>` elements, providing more meaningful structure to a webpage.

Here’s a list of 30 HTML5 semantic elements and other common elements that are often used in place of multiple `<div>` elements:

1. **`<div>`**: A generic container for grouping content.
2. **`<header>`**: Defines introductory content or a group of navigational links.
3. **`<footer>`**: Specifies footer content, like copyright or contact information.
4. **`<nav>`**: Represents a section of navigation links.
5. **`<article>`**: Represents a self-contained composition in a document.
6. **`<section>`**: Defines a section in a document, used for thematic grouping.
7. **`<aside>`**: Contains content tangentially related to the main content.
8. **`<main>`**: Represents the main content of a document.

Each of these elements can replace a `<div>` when the content it holds fits the semantic meaning of the element. Using these semantic elements improves the accessibility and SEO of your webpage.



The `<span>` tag itself is a general-purpose inline container with no specific meaning, used to style or manipulate small portions of text or other inline elements. There aren't multiple `<span>` tags, but there are several other useful inline elements that provide specific semantic meaning or structure to the content, which can be more appropriate than a generic `<span>`. Here is a list of some of the most useful inline elements:

1. **`<span>`**: A generic inline container for applying styles or attributes to small chunks of content.
